# Lab 13-3
Analyze the malware found in the file Lab13-03.exe.

## Static Analysis
- Imports

- Exports

- Miscellaneous
    - Signs of packing, encoding, decoding

- Embedded Strings

- CAPA Report

## Reverse Engineering
- `main` (`some address`)
    - Program entrypoint

## Dynamic Analysis
- Process Monitoring

- Registry

- Service

- Network


## Questions
1. Compare the output of strings with the information available via dynamic analysis. Based on this comparison, which elements might be encoded?

2. Use static analysis to look for potential encoding by searching for the string xor. What type of encoding do you find?

3. Use static tools like `FindCrypt2`, `KANAL`, and the `IDA Entropy Plugin` to identify any other encoding mechanisms. How do these findings compare with the XOR findings?

4. Which two encoding techniques are used in this malware?

5. For each encoding technique, what is the key?

6. For the cryptographic encryption algorithm, is the key sufficient? What else must be known?

7. What does this malware do?

8. Create code to decrypt some of the content produced during dynamic analysis. What is this content?
