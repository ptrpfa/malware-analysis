### Areas of Interest
- Referenced APIs
    - `OLEAUT32.dll` (malware utilises import by ordinal, which is indicative of suspicious behavior / could be for legitimate optimisations as well). Upon analysis using Dependency Walker, we observe the following imports by the malware: 
        - `00000002`: `SysAllocString`
        - `00000006`: `SysFreeString`
        - `00000008`: `VariantInit`
